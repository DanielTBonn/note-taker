# Note-Taker

## Description
  
As a student with a busy schedule, it is necessary to keep track of important information and events so that I do not miss anything. In an effort to build an application that can assist me with these problems, I developed a note taking program. I used back end solutions with express to populate our application with notes left by the user. I learned about client side requests and server side responses, the importance of modularizing your code, and was introduced to data persistance using JSON.

Go to the note-taker repo and enter node server.js into the CLI. On the webpage, add notes by pressing the + button and typing into the `Note Title` and `Note Text` sections, then press the save icon that appears in the top right corner next to the + button. Look at past notes by clicking on them and delete them by pressing the red trash can button to the side.
